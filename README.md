# comment-gpt README

This Extension interfaces with chatgpt to allow you to easily add inline comments, docstrings, or both to your functions.

## Features

There are 3 commands currently implemented in this extension
- Add Docstring
- Add Inline Comments
- Add Inline Comments and Docstring

## Requirements
In order to use this extension you have to have a valid ChatGPT API Key.

Creating one can be done [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
> This may require paying some amount for API tokens, however this extension uses ChatGPT version 3.5 therefore the usage is very small.

Once you have gotten our **API Key**, you can add it to the extension with the following commands.
1. Open Palette (Default Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Search "Add API Key"
3. Enter API key


## Known Issues

This extension primarily uses ChatGPT AI Langauge Model, therefore there may be instances where as well as providing docstrings/inline comments, it also includes flavour text. However this is rare.
